I used an Object for the state of Name and description because using usestate for each value might cause usestate hell, and when I want to add a new texfield, it would be easier, and I could also have gone for Formik or React Form, but for a small assignment, I don't need that.
What i can add to persist data when i reload like a mock api or json server to mimic the async data calling like the Api
